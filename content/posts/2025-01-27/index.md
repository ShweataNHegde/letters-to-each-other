Dear Arushi,

I think I have regressed as a writer because I tried hard to come up with a punchy, meaningful first line, only to fail miserably. First off, our journal website is officially up. It does not have all the crazy fantastical elements we want it to have. But it's a start and a rollercoaster ride that only goes up (reference from a book you absolutely hate).

Second, apologies for inaugurating the journal without asking you for a muhurtham. I thought I would surprise you with the website as a thank you for being my best friend at the Young India Fellowship. I cannot imagine life here without you. I am sorry that all you get is a sick and groggy me. Hopefully, from now on, my health stabilizes.

As January comes to an end, I am starting to feel a lot more anxious. Nothing new. A point in life has come again where I have to decide what my next life’s destination is. I feel like I was a bit too carefree in the first half of the Fellowship — did not set up a profile for Placements, have not written enough applications, or spoken to people. I am worried. And I know that you are in a similar position, too. But let's keep at it. One day at a time, right?

Today was an exhausting day of classes, and I really manifest that we get to do our Climate assignment together.

Until next time,

SNH
