Dear Shweata,

Sometimes the hardest thing you can do, is to begin. Which is why it is more than alright that you began the website without a set date and time. I wonder how long it might have taken us if we had gone through the traditional route. 

I do wish I had thought of a shared journal earlier in fellowship, there would been so many more reflections to make. Nevertheless, we have begun, and that is what it’s important. 

In the beginning, I was a little anxious to not find a friend who I could go to breakfast with, sit next to in class, and talk about life with. I am very grateful that we sat together for the first time in Makers of Modern India. It began with a small passer-by conversation and to say that the ‘rest is history’ would be appropriate. 

However, since then, times here have been challenging as well. In terms of future prospects, I feel lost (on the scale from 1-10, it is an 8). Planned decisions just went awry since mum was sick. Now it feels like a big question mark on the future of it. 
Interesting thing I read today: _There is no past, for it no longer exists; and that there is no future, for it does not yet exist._

I just hope that with the passage of time, and some head clearing, we are able to find paths that suit us post the fellowship (and which constantly run into each other). I cannot imagine time without you either. 

Regards, 

AB
