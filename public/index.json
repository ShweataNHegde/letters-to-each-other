First off, our journal website is officially up. It does not have all the crazy fantastical elements we want it to have. But it\u0026rsquo;s a start and a rollercoaster ride that only goes up (reference from a book you absolutely hate).\nSecond, apologies for inaugurating the journal without asking you for a muhurtham. I thought I would surprise you with the website as a thank you for being my best friend at the Young India Fellowship. I cannot imagine life here without you. I am sorry that all you get is a sick and groggy me. Hopefully, from now on, my health stabilizes.\nAs January comes to an end, I am starting to feel a lot more anxious. Nothing new. A point in life has come again where I have to decide what my next life’s destination is. I feel like I was a bit too carefree in the first half of the Fellowship — did not set up a profile for Placements, have not written enough applications, or spoken to people. I am worried. And I know that you are in a similar position, too. But let\u0026rsquo;s keep at it. One day at a time, right?\nToday was an exhausting day of classes, and I really manifest that we get to do our Climate assignment together.\nUntil next time,\nSNH\n","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-01-27/","section":"Posts","summary":"Thank You, Arushi","title":"SNH Letter #01","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
