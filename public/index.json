I wonder how long it might have taken us if we had gone through the traditional route.\nI do wish I had thought of a shared journal earlier in fellowship, there would been so many more reflections to make. Nevertheless, we have begun, and that is what it’s important.\nIn the beginning, I was a little anxious to not find a friend who I could go to breakfast with, sit next to in class, and talk about life with. I am very grateful that we sat together for the first time in Makers of Modern India. It began with a small passer-by conversation and to say that the ‘rest is history’ would be appropriate.\nHowever, since then, times here have been challenging as well. In terms of future prospects, I feel lost (on the scale from 1-10, it is an 8). Planned decisions just went awry since mum was sick. Now it feels like a big question mark on the future of it. Interesting thing I read today: There is no past, for it no longer exists; and that there is no future, for it does not yet exist.\nI just hope that with the passage of time, and some head clearing, we are able to find paths that suit us post the fellowship (and which constantly run into each other). I cannot imagine time without you either.\nRegards,\nAB\n","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-01-29/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"AB Letter #01","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/letters/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Letters","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Letters to Each Other","summary":"","title":"Letters to Each Other","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"2025-01-28\nDear Arushi,\nI think I have regressed as a writer because I tried hard to come up with a punchy, meaningful first line, only to fail miserably. First off, our journal website is officially up. It does not have all the crazy fantastical elements we want it to have. But it\u0026rsquo;s a start and a rollercoaster ride that only goes up (reference from a book you absolutely hate).\nSecond, apologies for inaugurating the journal without asking you for a muhurtham. I thought I would surprise you with the website as a thank you for being my best friend at the Young India Fellowship. I cannot imagine life here without you. I am sorry that all you get is a sick and groggy me. Hopefully, from now on, my health stabilizes.\nAs January comes to an end, I am starting to feel a lot more anxious. Nothing new. A point in life has come again where I have to decide what my next life’s destination is. I feel like I was a bit too carefree in the first half of the Fellowship — did not set up a profile for Placements, have not written enough applications, or spoken to people. I am worried. And I know that you are in a similar position, too. But let\u0026rsquo;s keep at it. One day at a time, right?\nToday was an exhausting day of classes, and I really manifest that we get to do our Climate assignment together.\nUntil next time,\nSNH\n","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-01-27/","section":"Posts","summary":"Thank You, Arushi","title":"SNH Letter #01","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"A place to keep track our activities together\u0026mdash;journal enhancements, movie lists, to-buy stuff, and more :)\nJournal To-Do List # Design Logo and Hero image Get Arushi on-board to use GitHub Decide posting frequency and writing style Brainstorm any immediate implementable ideas for the website ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/to-do-list/","section":"Letters to Each Other","summary":"","title":"To-Do List","type":"page"}]
